                    We can accommodate certain dietary restrictions and allergies. Please inform us of any allergies when placing your order.

                    Our cakes are best enjoyed at room temperature. If you need to store it, keep it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. For longer storage, refrigerate the cake in an airtight container and bring it to room temperature 1-2 hours before serving for the best flavor and texture.

                    Yes, our cocktail-inspired cakes do contain small amounts of alcohol to capture authentic flavors. The alcohol content is minimal as most of it evaporates during baking. We can also create non-alcoholic versions upon request. Please specify if you need an alcohol-free cake when ordering.

                    We recommend transporting cakes on a flat surface, such as the floor of your car or trunk. Avoid placing the cake on seats as they can tilt. Keep the car cool and drive carefully to prevent the cake from shifting. For tiered cakes, we provide special transportation instructions.
